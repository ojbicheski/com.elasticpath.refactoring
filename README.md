We would like you to complete a refactoring of the attached source code. You will find the instructions below. Once you have completed the 
refactoring, please send us a copy of your solution.
 
**Coding Task:**

Attached is a Mavenized Java project that we would like you to refactor/adapt as follows:

1) The objective is to refactor the provided code such that a new payment type could be added without modifying any existing Java code, thereby
making your solution "closed for modification and open for extension". Make sure that your changes do not expect callers to
FulfillmentPresenter.getPaymentString to make changes to their code (i.e. no functional behaviour changes).
2) Describe the approach you would take to unit test the existing code prior to making any of the changes for part 1.
 
_Deliverables:_

1) A changed version of the Java class representing the changes you would make. It doesn't have to compile, but should be reasonably valid Java. 
2) A description of your testing approach – example JUnit tests would be fine.
 
_Expectations:_

We do not expect you to spend more than 1 hour on this task. We expect you to be able to explain any tradeoffs and implementation decisions you 
have made. You are free to use any resources, books or the internet if you would like. But please don’t ask questions on forums, newsgroups, etc -
we would like to understand your personal approach.
